      <h1>Machine learning model for prediction of smartphone addiction</h1>
    <div class="cg-text">
      <p style="color:white"><h4>Smartphone addiction has become a growing concern in recent years. It can have negative impacts on mental health, social relationships, and overall well-being. Machine learning can provide a potential solution for predicting smartphone addiction before it becomes a serious problem.

In this study, we developed a machine learning model for predicting smartphone addiction using data from a large-scale survey. The survey included questions about demographics, smartphone usage patterns, and addiction symptoms. build the model and evaluated its performance using various metrics.

Our results showed that the model was able to predict smartphone addiction with high accuracy, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic. The most important features for predicting addiction were daily usage time, frequency of checking notifications, and age.

Our findings suggest that machine learning can be a powerful tool for predicting smartphone addiction and identifying individuals who are at risk. This could help healthcare professionals and policymakers develop targeted interventions to prevent and treat smartphone addiction. Further research is needed to validate our findings and explore the potential of machine learning in this area.
